=========

Mine stacking mod for Natural Selection 2

Allows placement of mines on top of mines. 

Also prevents reduction of mine count when darwinmode is on (unlimited mines!) 

This is primarily intended for hot mine-on-mine action with cheats on, but indeed works with cheats off (excepting darwinmode of course.)
